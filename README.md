## About

Always Balanced is a React Application, with a Rails backend which allows users to create a personalised schedule with the aim of allowing them to better balance their work and home life, thus keeping them always balanced. Always Balanced was created by Iona Brabender for her Mod 5 Project as part of Flatiron School's immersive Software Engineering Program.
